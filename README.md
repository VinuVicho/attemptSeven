My attempt to create a reddit-killer 
Basically, it's a simple server for sharing posts. 
After creating an account using your email (which you will need to verify), you will be able to create posts, view and comment on other users' posts, subscribe to other users, and like/dislike their comments and posts. Additionally, we have included a feature that allows you to block other users from seeing your posts.
